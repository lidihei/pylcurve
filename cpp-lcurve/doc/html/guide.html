<h1>Rough guide to lcurve</h1>

<p>
Quick start: run the command <a href="lroche.html">lroche</a> using the
<a href="example_model_file">example model</a>
and <a href="example_data_file">example data</a>.
Change one of the values (first number after an equals sign). Run again see
what happens.

<p>
This is a very brief starter guide for using 'lcurve'. Basically the idea is to
specify a model with a text file (<a href="example_model_file">example</a>). 
See <a href="lroche.html">lroche</a> for a detailed description of the format of this
file. It basically consists of shed loads of parameters. One tries to optimise these given some data
(see <a href="example_data_file">example data</a>) which has 6 columns;
see  <a href="lroche.html">lroche</a> for the specification of this as well. I have
tried several alternative optimisation methods; the only ones worth bothering 
with are coded in the routines <a href="simplex.html">simplex</a> and 
<a href="levmarq.html">levmarq</a> (you won't be confused as I have removed
the others). Ultimately <a href="levmarq.html">levmarq</a> is
probably the one you want, but if it seems to be struggling at first then
<a href="simplex.html">simplex</a> may do better. The advantage of 
<a href="levmarq.html">levmarq</a> is that it returns uncertainties, but always 
beware degeneracy which can lead to invalid results (including spurious minima)
from either routine. This leads me to the following warning: <strong>Be
  afraid, be very afraid of degeneracy in light curve fitting!</strong>
Although I said that only <a href="simplex.html">simplex</a> and 
<a href="levmarq.html">levmarq</a> are worth bothering with, they can easily
be led astray by degeneracy, typically stopping at a "minimum" that is in fact
far from it. In fact nowadays, I rarely use either of them but prefer MCMC
runs (which I implement using a Python wrapper independent of lcurve which
essentially just runs <a href="lroche.html">lroche</a>) as by far the best 
way to approach things. Its great advantage is that it makes it clear where
models are degenerate.

<p>
When starting off, use <a href="lroche.html">lroche</a> to see if you are
anywhere near right by explicitly specifying a device to plot to as in
"device=/xs" on the command line. <a href="lroche.html">lroche</a> is really
the heart of lcurve and playing around with it can teach you a lot. All
fitting parameters are documented in <a href="lroche.html">lroche</a>
so it is very much the first port of call.

<p>
The lcurve routines are not particularly clever, but just brute force
sub-divide the various components. When starting it is worth using relatively 
few grid points, and once you are close to the right solution, then up the
number. The command <a href="visualise.html">visualise</a> can be helpful
to show the grids.

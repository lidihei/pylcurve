<h1>Fits light-curve to a model with a binary star model using Levenberg-Marquardt</h1>
<p>
Using a file of supplied parameter values, <strong>levmarq</strong> tries to optimise
the fit between a light curve and a binary star model; see
<a href="lroche.html">lroche</a> for details of the model.  The minimisation uses
the Levenberg-Marquardt method which uses numerical derivatives. Centred
derivatives are used so that if N parameters are variable, one iteration can
require 2*N+1 full model calculations. The routine reports the value of the
lambda parameter that switches between inverse-Hessian (small lambda,
optimistic quadratic approximation to update the parameters) and steepest
descent (large lambda, needed when things become difficult, but slow in
general). The larger lambda becomes, the smaller the step size in the steepest
descent case.  Chi**2 values are reported whenever any decrease is
detected. The scale factor reported is the optimum multiplier from fit to data
and 'neval' is the number of model computations.  The routine skips the
derivative calculation in cases where chi**2 increases so the time between
steps during which lambda increases are shorter than those for which lambda
decreases.
<p>
It is always difficult to know when to stop in minimisation routines. This routine
stops for three reasons: (i) when a maximum iteration count is achieved, (ii) when
there has been a lack of progress measured by a failure to decrease in chi**2
three times in succession and (iii) when the value of lambda exceeds a user-defined
maximum.

<tr valign="top"><td><i>model</i></td><td>---</td><td>A file of initial parameter values and an indication of whether they should be varied
or not for physical parameters and name = value for others. See <a href="lroche.html">lroche</a> for a full description of these.
The amounts of variation will be used as step sizes for the numerical derivatives so choose carefully. NR says that
for centred derivatives, the optimal choice of step size = (acc)**(1/3) times a characteristic scale of your
function (or more precisely times (f/f''')**(1/3)), where acc is the fractional accuracy of the machine.
If we take this to be 10**-15 for double precision, then this implies 10**-5 times the scale over which you think 
the function changes lots.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><i>data</i></td><td>---</td><td>A light curve of times, exposure times, fluxes and uncertainties. # or blank to ignore,
negative errors to mask.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><i>nmax</i></td><td>---</td><td>The routine will stop if there have been this many iterations.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><i>delta</i></td><td>---</td><td>The change in chi**2 to require. This criterion only applies to steps where progress is being made
(i.e. the alambda parameter is going down). If the last three such steps have all failed to decrease chi**2 by
at least delta, then iterations will be halted.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><i>lmax</i></td><td>---</td><td>The maximum value of lambda to allow. Should be much larger than 1, e.g. 2e10, because the 
value of lambda is multiplied or divided by 10 each step according to progress.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><i>scale</i></td><td>---</td><td>true/false to scale the erros to give a reduced chi**2 = 1 or not. Generally advise yes.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><i>output</i></td><td>---</td><td>The file to store the final best model in</td></tr>

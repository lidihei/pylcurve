Description: # pylcurve
        This a python wrapper for lcurve written by Thomas Marsh
        
        
        'lcurve' is for modelling of light curves.
        
        Installation order: subs --> colly, binary --> roche --> lcurve  (https://github.com/trmrsh/cpp-lcurve)
        
        
        The package of cpp-subs is based on pcre, pgplot, and slalib(C version)
        
        
        # installation:
        
        - set environment variables (e.g. write them into ~/.bashrc)
        export TRM_SOFTWARE= the_prefix_directory 
        export CPPFLAGS="-I$CONDA_PREFIX/include/ -I$TRM_SOFTWARE/local/include"
        export LDFLAGS="-L$CONDA_PREFIX/lib -L$TRM_SOFTWARE/local/lib"
        export CFLAGS="-I$CONDA_PREFIX/include/"
        
        $CONDA_PREFIX
        conda install -c anaconda pcre
        if you install the pcre by using conda, then you should modified environment file of the include and lib
        
        - install slalib (C version)
        should ask Tom Marsh Warwick (T.R.Marsh@warwick.ac.uk) to get this package
        tar -xcf sla.tar.gz
        cd sla-1.0.5
        autoreconf -f -i -s
        ./configure --prefix=$CONDA_PREFIX
        make install
        make
        
        The file called 'Lcurve' that is generated in this directory defines
        aliases (csh-style) and prints a help message when sourced.

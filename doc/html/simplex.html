<h1>Fits light-curve to a model with a sphere plus Roche-lobe distorted star using simplex method</h1>
<p>
Using a file of supplied parameter values, <strong>simplex</strong> tries to optimise the fit between
a light curve and a model of a spherical and tidally distorted star. This is 
supposed to model a white dwarf/main-sequence binary such as NN Ser. It includes
reprocessing and eclipses. The reprocessing is computed using the simple addition of
fluxes method, assuming that the irradiating star can be treated as a point, and not 
including any 'back heating'. Phase 0 is defined as the point when star 1 is furthest from the observer.
Star 1 is the spherical one. Efforts are made to save time by using a coarser grid away from eclipse
and using no sub-division for these phases. This comes with some danger, mainly of discontinuities
at the cross over points. A rescaling is computed from the values of each grid at a cross-over point.
They should be close to 1. Setting all the element sizes to the same value will avoid any such problem, 
but will be slow.
<p>
The minimisation uses the simplex method via the Numerical Recipes routine 'amoeba' which works with 
a group of N+1 points in N dimensional space and moves the points around to move downhill in chi**2.
It is slow but robust.
